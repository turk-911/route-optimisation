In today’s increasingly interconnected and efficiency-driven global economy, the optimization of transportation and logistical operations is paramount across a wide spectrum of industries, including supply chain management, public sector services, and urban infrastructure systems. Central to these efforts is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) — a foundational combinatorial optimization challenge that seeks to determine the most cost-effective set of routes for a fleet of vehicles tasked with servicing a distributed set of demands or customer locations. Efficiently solving the VRP enables organizations to significantly reduce operational expenses, fuel consumption, and travel time, thereby enhancing service levels and contributing to broader goals such as sustainability and intelligent transport systems. Leveraging Python and its rich ecosystem of optimization libraries provides a powerful and flexible framework for modeling and solving complex variants of the VRP with real-world constraints.
